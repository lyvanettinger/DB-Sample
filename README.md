# DialogueBox

A barebones project I made to learn basic DX12 (and eventually font rendering) with. It has set out to become a bit of a framework along the way.
#### It features:
- A complete bindless model (for buffers + textures)
- DXC shader compilation
- Basic wrappers for command queues and descriptor heaps

#### Future plans:
- Basic font rendering

## How to build
(TODO: write out)

CMake

Run Setup.bat
